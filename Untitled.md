-- Places Unknown --



I've been following my dreams

Or have they been the ones following me (I don't know)

I've sailed all the seas

To places unknown and unforgiving



The fire in your eyes

Surprises me every time, my darling

All my birds they take flight

To places unknown and unforgiving



The language that you speak

Has got me on my knees, I'm waiting

for salvation so sweet

In a place unknown and unforgiving



I've been following my dreams

Or have they been the ones following me (I don't know)

I've sailed all the seas

To places unknown and unforgiving
